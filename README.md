# Learning to play Flappy Bird using Deep Q-Networks

## Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an emerging domain in machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the cumulative reward. In this project, we use a very popular algorithm in RL, called Deep Q-Networks and show that it is very effective at learning to play a game like Flappy bird despite having a high-dimensional sensory input. The agent is given no prior information about what the bird looks like and what the pipes do. The agent must learn these representations and use it to develop an optimal strategy to maximize the cumulative reward. We further show that the agent is able to achieve super-human performance and discuss on the problems and potential improvements with DQN.
